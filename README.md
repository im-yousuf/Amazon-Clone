# 🛒 Amazon Clone – My First Web Project

This is my first web development project, where I tried to recreate the Amazon homepage using only HTML and CSS.
It’s a simple static clone created to practice layout design, styling, and understanding how big websites structure their UI.
Since this is my first project, it may contain bugs, alignment issues, or non-responsive sections — but I’m learning and improving! 😄
