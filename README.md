# Amazon-Clone
🛒 Amazon Clone – My First Web Project  This is my first web development project, where I tried to recreate the Amazon homepage using only HTML and CSS. It’s a simple static clone — not responsive yet — but I built it completely from scratch to practice my frontend skills and understand website structure better.
